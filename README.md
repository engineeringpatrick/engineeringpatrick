- 💻 I'm a software engineer that likes to play around with game development and whatever floats my boat (or whatever I get paid to do).
- 👨‍💻 My current interests are full stack development with Typescript (all frameworks welcome) and low-level engineering with C++/Rust.
- 📚 I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student @ Concordia University.
